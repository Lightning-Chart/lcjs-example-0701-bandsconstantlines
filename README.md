# JavaScript Chart Bands and Constant lines

![JavaScript Chart Bands and Constant lines](bandsConstantLines-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Also known as Highlighters.

This example shows the basic usage of Bands and Constantlines in a XY Chart.

Bands and Constantlines are attached to the Axes of a XY Chart.
Bands and Constantlines can be interacted with mouse and touch controls.

Depending where you touch on the band, you can move either end of the Band separately by touching the edge of the Band, or you can move the entire Band by touching the center of the Band.

They can be easily added to an Axis:

```javascript
// Add a Constantline to an Axis
const constantline = axis.addConstantLine()

//Add a Band to an Axis
const band = axis.addBand()

// By default, the Band and Constantline are placed above all Series in the Chart.
// They can also be placed below all Series by passing *true* as argument when creating one.
const constantLline = axis.addConstantLine(false)

const band = axis.addBand(false)
```

## Positioning

The position of a Constantline can be set using the _setValue()_ API:

```javascript
// Set the position of a Constantline
constantline.setValue(50)
```

The position and size of a Band is set by using the _setValueStart()_ and _setValueEnd()_ API:

```javascript
// Set the start value of a Band
band.setValueStart(20)
// Set the end value of a Band
band.setValueEnd(40)
```

## Styling

Constantlines can be styled by using the _setStrokeStyle()_ API:

```javascript
// Style the Constantline
constantline.setStrokeStyle(
    new SolidLine({
        thickness: 5
        fillStyle: new SolidFill({
            color: ColorHEX('#fff')
        })
    })
)
```

Bands can be styled by using the _setStrokeStyle()_ and _setFillStyle()_ API accordingly:

```javascript
// Style the Band border
band.setStrokeStyle(
    new SolidLine({
        thickness: 5
        fillStyle: new SolidFill({
            color: ColorHEX('#fff')
        })
    })
)
// Style the Band's fillStyle
band.setFillStyle(
    new SolidFill({
        color: ColorHEX('#fff')
    })
)
```
